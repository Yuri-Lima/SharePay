# SharePay
### About Us
The idea of the application was to divide the energy costs of my house with the house next door as we have share the same energy bill. However, the difference is that I have installed a meter in my house to know exactly how many kilowatts of energy I was using each month. Every month would require the tedious job of entering all of the data into a spreadsheet that I had created. Then I would need to also check if all of the residents were still in the house, calculating the difference in kilowatts and doing the overall maths of converting everything into cost of usage. 

Due to this my greatest concern and consideration was to ensure/always know if the division was correct between everyone currently living in the house, because there is nothing more annoying than overpaying for energy you haven't actually used. With that, to end this stress and reduce confusion, I decided to create this app to optimize both my life and the lives of other people.

The SharePay logo actually came about as the idea consists of both the sound of the name, which is very similar to the dog breed depicted in the design, but also because the applications purpose is that of being a friendly shoulder when we need to put stress aside and optimize our time. Plus as we all know who is man's best friend? That is right, the dog! Therefore, I hope that the application will be able to free you from the stress of dividing bills, giving you free time, and preventing fights among the residents in case the bill goes wrong.

Enjoy!😊

### Features

The application can help you on several occasions, as you can check below:

 * One House 🏡
   One or more residents 👩  👩‍👩‍👧‍👧
   Same or different period 📆

 * One House and one Subhouse 🏡
   Same Meter 🧭
   One or more residents 👩  👩‍👩‍👧‍👧
   Same or different period 📆
   
 * One House and one Subhouse 🏡
   Different Meter 🧭
   One or more residents 👩  👩‍👩‍👧‍👧
   Same or different period 📆
  
🚩But please note that if you have a room inside your house where there is actually separate meter inside. Then you must register this as a 'sub house!' * Don't forget to follow this format. * 🚩

When you are registering your account do not forget to add the account amount, the amount of kilowatts spent (you will find this in your bill📝), the name of the residents and the correct period of each one (This is to ensure there is no error in the time of division).

By following the correct simple steps of the application, we ensure that in five minutes all of the calculations are carried out by the app which will return a report containing all of the information provided by the user, detailing exactly how much each resident will pay. Then with all of that time saved, sit back and relax or go out and enjoy the sunny day🌞!

**2026 Migration Notice**

This repository has been **fully migrated** from the original Python/Django codebase to a **pnpm + Nx TypeScript monorepo** (NestJS backend + Angular frontend).

- 100% bill splitting logic preserved in `libs/calculator` (tested for parity).
- See `MIGRATION.md`, `PERFORMANCE_SECURITY_AUDIT.md`, `FINAL_REVIEW.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Old Django code is retained in git history only.
- All new development, Docker, CI, tests use the modern stack.
- `pnpm` is the **exclusive** package manager.

To run the old version refer to git tag `pre-migration` or original heroku deploy. New production is the TS stack.
