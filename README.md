### About Us
The idea of the application was to divide the energy costs of my house with the house next door as we have the same energy bill. However, the difference is that I have installed a meter in my house, to know exactly how much kilowatts I was spending monthly. Every month it was the job of entering the data into the spreadsheet, seeing if all the residents were still in the house, knowing the difference in kilowatts and doing the math. My greatest care and fear were always to know if the division was correct between everyone because there is nothing more annoying about you overpaying. With that, to end this stress, I decided to create this app to optimize both my life and the lives of other people.

The SharePay logo was the idea of both the sound of the name, which is very similar to the dog breed of the design also of the application being our friendly shoulder when we need to put stress aside and optimize our time. And who is man's best friend? That is right, the dog! Therefore, I hope that the application will be able to free you from the stress of dividing bills, giving you free time, and preventing fights among the residents in case the bill goes wrong.

Enjoy!😊

When you are registering your account do not forget to add the account amount, the amount of kilowatts spent (you will find this in your bill📝), the name of the residents and the correct period of each one (so there is no error in the time of division).
Following the correct steps of the application, in five minutes we will do all the work and give you a report which will contain the information given by you and how much each resident will pay. After that, just go enjoy the sunny day🌞!
